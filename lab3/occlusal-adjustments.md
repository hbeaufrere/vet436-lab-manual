# Occlusal Adjustments of Incisors, Premolars and Molars

## Premolars and Molars

### Instruments

- Straight handpiece (low-speed)
- Medium round diamond bur
- Cement spatula
- Tongue spatula
- Q-tips

### Procedure

Using the endoscope for visualization, perform occlusal adjustment of the premolars and molars (cheek teeth):

1. Place the round diamond bur on the straight handpiece (low-speed).
2. Under endoscopic guidance, identify the cheek teeth that require adjustment (e.g., spurs, uneven occlusal plane, elongated crowns).
3. Use a **cement spatula** to protect the soft tissues (buccal mucosa and tongue) from the rotating bur.
4. Apply the rotating diamond bur to the occlusal surface of the cheek teeth with a **light touch**. The goal is to restore a normal, flat occlusal plane.
5. Work progressively, removing small amounts of tooth at a time. Frequently reassess the occlusal plane with the endoscope.
6. **Avoid thermal damage**: use a light, intermittent touch rather than continuous pressure. No cooling fluid is used, so brief contact is essential to prevent overheating the tooth and damaging the pulp.
7. Use Q-tips to remove debris from the oral cavity during the procedure.

### Perform the Adjustment

Perform occlusal adjustment of the cheek teeth on your specimen. Restore a normal occlusal plane.

## Incisors

### Instruments

- High-speed angled handpiece
- Cylindrical diamond bur
- Tongue depressor

### Procedure

Perform crown reduction of the incisors:

1. Remove the pouch dilator to access the incisors.
2. Place a **tongue depressor** between the upper and lower incisors to protect the opposing teeth and soft tissues during the procedure.
3. Attach the **cylindrical diamond bur** to the high-speed angled handpiece.
4. Reduce the crown height of the incisor to restore the normal chisel-shaped occlusal plane.
5. Avoid exposing the **pulp cavity** — leave at least **0.5 mm coronal to the gingival papilla** to maintain an adequate safety margin.
6. Shape the incisor to restore the proper chisel shape and angle of the occlusal surface.

### Perform the Adjustment

Perform incisor crown reduction on your specimen. After the adjustment, clean the oral cavity with Q-tips and remove any debris.

### Check Occlusion

After completing all adjustments, check both **premolar-molar occlusion** and **incisor occlusion**:

- The cheek teeth occlusal plane should be flat and even.
- The mandibular incisors should rest between the maxillary peg teeth (I3) and the main upper incisors (I1).
- The chisel edge of the mandibular incisor should contact the palatal surface of the maxillary I1.
