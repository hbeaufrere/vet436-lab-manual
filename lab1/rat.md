# Rat and Mouse Anatomy

## Rat Prosection

1. **Evaluate the gastrointestinal tract and compare with the other species** -- the rat is an omnivore with a GI tract reflecting this dietary flexibility. The stomach is divided into two compartments by the limiting ridge (margo plicatus): a non-glandular forestomach (pars proventricularis) and a glandular stomach (pars glandularis). The non-glandular portion is lined with keratinized squamous epithelium and serves as a storage compartment, while the glandular portion contains gastric glands for enzymatic digestion. The cecum is large and well-developed, reflecting the capacity for hindgut fermentation.

   **Important**: Rats (and mice) cannot vomit due to the anatomy of the limiting ridge, the relative strength of the crural sling of the diaphragm, and the lack of a brainstem emetic reflex. This has clinical implications for anesthetic protocols and toxin ingestion.

2. **Evaluate the oral cavity** -- note the prominent diastema between the incisors and molars (no canine or premolar teeth in rats). The dental formula is 1/1, 0/0, 0/0, 3/3 = 16 teeth. The incisors are open-rooted (aradicular hypsodont) and grow continuously, while the molars are rooted (anelodont) and do not grow continuously. Note the infolding of the lips into the diastema, which separates the oral cavity into an anterior and posterior compartment. This prevents ingestion of non-food material while gnawing.

3. **Evaluate the harderian gland** -- located behind the eye, this gland produces porphyrin-rich secretions (red-brown pigment). Excessive porphyrin secretion (chromodacryorrhea or "red tears") is a sign of stress, illness, or pain. It is distributed over the fur during grooming and can be mistaken for blood.

4. **Evaluate the male reproductive tract** -- the rat has large, prominent testes relative to body size. The inguinal canals remain open throughout life (open inguinal rings), allowing the testes to move freely between the scrotal and abdominal positions. As with the guinea pig, the open inguinal rings must be closed during castration.

   **Male accessory sex organs** include the seminal vesicles (very large, paired, coiled tubular glands), coagulating glands (anterior prostate), ventral prostate, dorsolateral prostate, and bulbourethral glands. The seminal vesicles and coagulating glands produce secretions that form a copulatory plug in the female vagina after mating. The preputial glands produce pheromones and can become impacted or develop abscesses. The os penis is present.

5. **Evaluate the female reproductive tract** -- the rat has a duplex uterus with two completely separate uterine horns, each with its own cervix opening into a common vagina. The ovaries are enclosed within an ovarian bursa. Mammary tissue is extensive and distributed widely across the body.

6. **Evaluate the mammary gland distribution** -- mammary tissue in the rat is extensive, extending from the cervical region (near the salivary glands) to the inguinal region. There are typically 6 pairs of mammary glands: 3 thoracic (cervical, thoracic cranial, thoracic caudal) and 3 abdominal/inguinal (abdominal cranial, abdominal caudal, inguinal). Mammary tumors are among the most common neoplasms in rats, particularly in females. Fibroadenomas are the most common type in rats and are often benign, but can grow very large.

7. **Evaluate the thoracic and abdominal organs** -- note the thymus, which persists into adulthood in the rat (unlike many other species). The spleen is a long, flat, tongue-shaped organ.

## Mouse Anatomy

The mouse shares many anatomical features with the rat. The following images illustrate key features of mouse anatomy for comparison.

### Mouse Male Reproductive System
