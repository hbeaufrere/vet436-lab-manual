For the first hour, you will have four 15-minute presentations on small mammal anatomy using a prosection of a rabbit, ferret, guinea pig, and rat.

The prosections depict some of the anatomy that was covered in the lectures. In this lab, you will be able to translate knowledge introduced in the lecture to the real anatomy on the cadaver.

For the second hour of the lab, you will be dissecting a rabbit and a rat.
