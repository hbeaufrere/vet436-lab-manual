# Ferret Anatomy

1. **Evaluate the coat** -- any thinning? Endocrine alopecia is common in ferrets and can be associated with adrenal disease.

2. **Evaluate the location of the heart in the thoracic cavity** -- the heart is located very caudally compared to other species. This is clinically relevant for radiographic interpretation and cardiac auscultation.

3. **Evaluate the gastrointestinal tract** of this carnivore. A very simple, short GI tract that is typical for a carnivore. The jejunum and ileum are indistinguishable and are coiled together as the jejunoileum. There is a lack of a cecum and appendix. The ileocolic junction is only differentiated by the region where the ileocolic and jejunal arteries join.

4. **Evaluate the location of the adrenal glands, the blood vessels surrounding the adrenals, and their relationship with other organs** -- what is the relevance to common diseases?

   The right adrenal gland lies craniomedial to the right kidney and is closely associated with the caudal vena cava. The left adrenal gland lies ventromedial to the cranial pole of the left kidney. Adrenal disease (adrenocortical neoplasia or hyperplasia) is one of the most common conditions in ferrets. Surgical adrenalectomy, particularly of the right adrenal gland, is challenging due to its intimate association with the vena cava.

5. **Gently palpate the pancreas for nodules** -- what is the clinical relevance?

   Insulinoma (pancreatic beta-cell tumor) is one of the most common neoplasms in ferrets. Palpable nodules in the pancreas may indicate insulinoma. The pancreas has two limbs: the right limb lies along the descending duodenum, and the left limb extends toward the spleen and stomach.

6. **Evaluate mesenteric lymph nodes** -- mesenteric lymph nodes are large even in health, especially at the mesenteric root. They can be mistaken for a lesion! Do not confuse normal large lymph nodes with pathology.

7. **Male urogenital anatomy**: Evaluate the bladder, prostate, os penis, and urethral opening. The most common emergency presentation is urinary blockage. Name two etiologies for this (adrenal disease causing prostatic enlargement, and urolithiasis). A tube cystotomy can sometimes be necessary to provide urinary relief.

8. **Female urogenital anatomy**: Evaluate the uterus, ovaries, and vulva. Vulvar swelling can be a sign of adrenal disease or ovarian remnant syndrome in spayed ferrets.
