# Appendix A: Anatomical and Biological Characteristics of Rabbits

## Integument

1. **Thin, delicate skin** that is easily torn. Care must be taken during handling, restraint, and any surgical procedures.
2. **Dewlap**: A fold of skin under the chin, more prominent in intact females and obese rabbits. Used for fur pulling to line the nest during pregnancy. Susceptible to moist dermatitis ("wet dewlap").
3. **Scent glands**:
   - **Inguinal glands**: Located in the inguinal skin folds lateral to the genitalia. Produce a brown, waxy, odorous secretion. Can accumulate debris and require periodic cleaning.
   - **Chin gland (submandibular gland)**: Used for territorial marking ("chinning" behavior). Rabbits rub their chin on objects to deposit scent.
4. **Fur**: Rabbits have a dense, soft coat. They undergo seasonal molting. Fur should be lustrous and free of mats, alopecia, or ectoparasites.
   - Rabbits lack footpads; the plantar surface of the feet is covered with dense fur only.
   - Rex breeds have thinner foot fur and are predisposed to pododermatitis.
5. **Open inguinal rings**: The inguinal canals remain open throughout life in both sexes. In males, the testicles can be retracted into the abdomen. This has implications for castration technique (the inguinal rings should be closed during neutering to prevent herniation).
6. **Syringe-like (needle-like) claws**: Sharp claws that can cause significant scratches to handlers. Regular nail trimming is recommended.

## Special Senses

### Eyes
- Rabbits have **laterally placed eyes** providing a nearly **360-degree field of vision** with a small blind spot directly in front of the nose and directly behind the head.
- Large, prominent globes with a large corneal surface.
- **Retrobulbar venous plexus**: A large venous sinus behind the globe. This is important clinically because retrobulbar abscesses (commonly from molar tooth root elongation) and retrobulbar fat deposits can cause exophthalmos.
- **Third eyelid (nictitating membrane)**: Present and well-developed. Contains the Harderian gland.
- **Meibomian glands**: Present in the eyelids. The secretion of the Harderian gland contains porphyrins, which may cause a reddish-brown discoloration around the eyes (can be mistaken for blood).
- **Pupillary light reflex (PLR)**: Relatively slow and incomplete compared to dogs and cats. Both consensual and direct PLR are present but may be subtle.
- **Nasolacrimal duct**: Single punctum on the lower eyelid. The duct follows a tortuous course through the maxilla near the tooth roots, opening at the nasal punctum. Susceptible to obstruction from dental disease.

### Ears
- **Large pinnae** with extensive vascularization, serving as the primary organ for **thermoregulation**. Rabbits dissipate heat through vasodilation of the ear vasculature.
- **Central ear artery**: Runs along the dorsal midline of the pinna. Used for arterial blood gas sampling.
- **Marginal ear vein (lateral ear vein)**: Located on the lateral edge of the pinna. Used for venipuncture and IV catheter placement.
- **Caudal ear vein**: Located on the caudal/medial aspect of the pinna.
- Lop-eared breeds are predisposed to **otitis externa** and **otitis media** due to the folded, pendulous ear conformation that impairs ventilation and drainage of the ear canal.

### Smell
- Rabbits have an excellent **sense of smell** with a large olfactory epithelium.
- The **vomeronasal organ (Jacobson's organ)** is present and used for pheromone detection.
- Nose twitching ("wiggling") is a normal behavior that enhances olfaction.

## Respiratory System

1. **Obligate nasal breathers**: Rabbits breathe exclusively through their nose under normal circumstances. The elongated soft palate rests on the base of the epiglottis. Open-mouth breathing is a sign of **severe respiratory distress** and is an emergency.
2. **Small oral cavity and large tongue**: Makes endotracheal intubation challenging. Blind intubation or the use of an endoscope is often necessary.
3. **Relatively small thoracic cavity** compared to the abdomen. The lungs have relatively small tidal volume. The large abdominal viscera can further compromise respiratory capacity, especially in obese rabbits or those with GI distension.
4. **Thymus**: The thymus persists into adulthood in rabbits (does not involute as in other species). It is located in the cranial mediastinum and can be visible on thoracic radiographs as a soft tissue opacity in the cranioventral thorax. It should not be mistaken for a mass.

## Body Fat Composition

1. **Subcutaneous fat**: Can be extensive, especially in obese rabbits. Contributes to the dewlap in females.
2. **Intra-abdominal fat (falciform fat and mesenteric fat)**: Can be abundant. In obese rabbits, large fat deposits can impair abdominal palpation and contribute to hepatic lipidosis if the rabbit becomes anorexic.
3. **Retroperitoneal fat**: Fat deposits around the kidneys and in the retroperitoneal space.
4. **Retrobulbar fat**: Fat deposits behind the eyes. Can contribute to mild exophthalmos in obese rabbits.

## Gastrointestinal System

1. **Dental formula: I2/1, C0/0, P3/2, M3/3 = 28 teeth.**
   - All teeth are **elodont** (open-rooted, continuously growing), including incisors, premolars, and molars.
   - Growth rate of incisors is approximately **2 mm per week** (10-12 cm/year).
   - The upper incisors have a pair of small **peg teeth** (second incisors) located directly behind the primary incisors.
   - There is a wide **diastema** (gap) between the incisors and premolars due to the absence of canine teeth.
   - Malocclusion and dental disease are extremely common clinical problems.

2. **Stomach**:
   - The stomach is relatively large, comprising about **15% of GI tract volume**.
   - It has a thin muscular wall and rabbits are **unable to vomit** due to a well-developed cardiac sphincter.
   - The stomach is divided into regions: cardia, fundus, body, and pylorus.
   - The stomach should always contain some ingesta. An empty stomach is abnormal.
   - The stomach pH is very acidic (pH 1-2), which helps kill ingested bacteria and protease activation.

3. **Small intestine**:
   - Comprised of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
   - Relatively short compared to the large intestine.
   - The **bile duct** and **pancreatic duct** open into the duodenum.
   - The **sacculus rotundus** is a round, lymphoid-rich structure at the ileocecal junction (ileal-cecal-colic junction). It functions as a lymphoid organ (similar to a tonsil for the GI tract).

4. **Large intestine (cecum, colon, and rectum)**:

   **Cecum:**
   - The cecum is the largest organ in the rabbit's abdomen, comprising approximately **40% of the total GI tract volume**.
   - It is a thin-walled, coiled, sacculated structure located in the ventral and right abdomen.
   - The **appendix (vermiform appendix)** is located at the tip of the cecum. It is rich in lymphoid tissue (gut-associated lymphoid tissue, GALT) and functions as an immune organ.
   - The cecum is the primary site of **microbial fermentation** (hindgut fermenter). The resident microbiota (primarily anaerobic bacteria) ferment fiber to produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which are an important energy source.
   - Normal cecal content is a homogeneous, olive-green, pasty material with a characteristic odor.

   **Colon:**
   - The colon is divided into the **proximal colon** and the **distal colon**, separated by the **fusus coli**.
   - **Proximal colon**: Contains haustrations (sacculations) and is the site where separation of digestible and indigestible fiber occurs. This is critical for the formation of cecotrophs versus hard fecal pellets.
   - **Fusus coli**: A unique structure (pacemaker) that acts as a physiological sphincter between the proximal and distal colon. It controls the separation mechanism and determines whether cecotrophs or hard fecal pellets are produced. It functions as a colonic pacemaker, controlling motility patterns.
   - **Distal colon**: Produces the final hard fecal pellets through water reabsorption and mucus coating.

5. **Cecotrophy (coprophagy)**:
   - Rabbits produce two types of fecal material:
     - **Hard fecal pellets**: Round, dry, fibrous pellets produced during the day. These represent the indigestible fiber portion.
     - **Cecotrophs (soft feces, "night feces")**: Soft, mucus-coated clusters of dark, grape-like pellets typically produced in the early morning or at night. These are rich in B vitamins, volatile fatty acids, microbial proteins, and other nutrients.
   - Rabbits **ingest cecotrophs directly from the anus** as part of normal digestive physiology. This is essential for adequate nutrition.
   - Cecotrophs should not be confused with diarrhea. True diarrhea in rabbits is an emergency.

6. **GI transit time**: Approximately **4-5 hours** for the entire GI tract. Fiber is essential to maintain normal GI motility. A high-fiber diet (primarily grass hay) is critical for dental health and GI function.

7. **GI stasis (ileus)**: The most common GI disorder in rabbits. Caused by decreased motility of the GI tract, leading to dehydration and impaction of stomach and cecal contents. Predisposing factors include low-fiber diet, dehydration, stress, pain, dental disease, and obesity. This is a medical emergency.

## Liver

1. The liver is composed of **four main lobes**: right, left (divided into medial and lateral), caudate, and quadrate.
2. Rabbits have a **gallbladder**.
3. The primary bile pigment is **biliverdin** (not bilirubin as in dogs and cats), giving the bile a green color.
4. Rabbits are susceptible to **hepatic lipidosis** (fatty liver disease), particularly obese rabbits that become anorexic. Rapid fat mobilization leads to hepatic fat accumulation and liver failure.
5. **Hepatic coccidiosis** (*Eimeria stiedae*) is a parasitic disease that affects the bile ducts and liver, causing white nodular lesions.

---

## Musculoskeletal System

1. **Lightweight skeleton**: The skeleton comprises only about **7-8% of total body weight** (compared to ~13% in cats). This makes rabbit bones relatively fragile and susceptible to fractures.
2. **Powerful hind limbs**: The hind legs are very muscular and powerful, adapted for jumping and running. If a rabbit kicks out forcefully while unsupported (e.g., during improper handling), it can fracture its own **lumbar spine**, leading to spinal cord injury and hind limb paralysis.
3. **Seven lumbar vertebrae**: The lumbar spine is long and vulnerable to fracture, particularly at the **L7-S1 junction**.
4. **Flexion of the spine**: Rabbits naturally adopt a hunched posture. Forced extension of the spine should be avoided.
5. **Dewclaws**: Rabbits have 5 digits on the forelimbs (including a dewclaw) and 4 digits on the hind limbs.

## Urinary System

### Kidneys
- Rabbits have two kidneys. The **right kidney** is more cranial and the **left kidney** is more caudal and mobile.
- Kidneys are unipapillate (single renal papilla).
- Rabbits excrete excess **calcium through the kidneys** (rather than through the bile as in most other mammals). This results in characteristically thick, creamy, white-to-orange urine with high calcium carbonate content.
- Normal urine pH is **alkaline (pH 8-9)**.

### Urine Characteristics
- Normal rabbit urine can range in color from **yellow to orange to red-brown** due to porphyrin and other plant pigment excretion. This is normal and should not be confused with hematuria.
- Urine is normally **turbid and thick** due to calcium carbonate crystals.
- True hematuria can be differentiated from pigmenturia by urinalysis and urine dipstick testing.
- Excessive calcium in the diet can lead to **urinary sludge** (hypercalciuria) and **urolithiasis** (calcium carbonate stones).

## Reproductive System

### Female
- Rabbits have a **duplex uterus** (two separate uterine horns, each with its own cervix). There is no uterine body.
- Rabbits are **induced ovulators**: ovulation occurs in response to mating (coitus), not on a regular cycle. Therefore, they do not have a true estrous cycle but are in an almost continuous state of receptivity.
- **Gestation period**: 29-35 days (average 31 days).
- **Litter size**: 4-10 kits (variable by breed).
- Kits are born **altricial** (blind, deaf, and hairless).
- Does nurse their kits only **once or twice daily** (typically at dawn and dusk), for only a few minutes each time. This is normal and should not be interpreted as maternal neglect.
- **Uterine adenocarcinoma** is the most common neoplasm in intact female rabbits. The incidence increases dramatically with age:
  - Up to **50-80% of intact does** over 5-6 years of age may develop uterine adenocarcinoma.
  - It can metastasize to the lungs, liver, and other organs.
  - **Ovariohysterectomy (spaying)** is strongly recommended for all non-breeding female rabbits, ideally by 6 months to 1 year of age.
- Other reproductive disorders include pyometra, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial aneurysms.

### Male
- **Testicles**: Large, elongated, and positioned in the inguinal region cranial to the penis. Males have **open inguinal rings**, allowing the testicles to be retracted into the abdomen.
- **Castration**: Recommended for behavioral management and to prevent breeding. The inguinal rings should be **closed** during the castration procedure to prevent intestinal herniation.
- The **penis** is directed **caudally** (posteriorly) in the resting position. The penis can be extruded from the prepuce for examination.
- Sexual maturity: **6-10 months** of age (varies by breed; smaller breeds mature earlier).
- Male rabbits can remain fertile for **4-6 weeks after castration** due to residual sperm in the reproductive tract.
- **Breeding onset (buck)**: 6-10 months of age.
