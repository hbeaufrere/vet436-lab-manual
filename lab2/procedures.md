# Procedures

## Nasolacrimal Duct Flush

The nasolacrimal duct in rabbits has a single punctum located on the **lower eyelid** (ventromedial conjunctival fornix), near the medial canthus. The duct follows a tortuous path through the maxilla, passing close to the root of the upper incisor and the maxillary premolars/molars before opening at the **nasal punctum** (at the mucocutaneous junction of the nostril). Because of its proximity to tooth roots, dental disease is a common cause of nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

### Indications

- **Epiphora** (excessive tearing) and dacryocystitis (infection/inflammation of the nasolacrimal duct).
- Evaluation of nasolacrimal duct **patency**.
- **Therapeutic flushing** to relieve obstruction from inspissated pus (commonly associated with *Pasteurella multocida*).

### Equipment

- 24- or 26-gauge **lacrimal cannula** or intravenous catheter (without the stylet).
- 1 mL or 3 mL syringe.
- **Sterile saline** (0.9% NaCl) for flushing.
- Ophthalmic **topical anesthetic** (e.g., proparacaine 0.5%) - optional, can help with patient comfort.
- Magnification (loupes) may be helpful.

### Procedure

1. **Sedate the rabbit** if not already sedated. Restraint with the burrito technique may be sufficient in some cases.
2. Optionally, apply **topical ophthalmic anesthetic** (proparacaine) to the eye. Wait 30-60 seconds for it to take effect.
3. Identify the **lower lacrimal punctum**. It is located on the medial aspect of the lower eyelid, in the ventromedial conjunctival fornix, near the medial canthus. It may be difficult to visualize - gently evert the lower eyelid and look for a small opening.
4. Attach the **lacrimal cannula** (or IV catheter without stylet) to a syringe filled with sterile saline.
5. Gently insert the cannula into the **lower punctum**. Direct the cannula ventrally and nasally.
6. Slowly and gently **flush** sterile saline through the duct. Do not use excessive pressure.
7. If the duct is **patent**, saline will exit from the **nasal punctum** at the nostril. You may see fluid dripping from the nose.
8. If resistance is encountered, the duct may be **obstructed**. Do not force the flush. Gentle, pulsatile pressure may help dislodge small obstructions.
9. Note the character of any material that is flushed out (clear, mucoid, purulent). Purulent material is commonly associated with *Pasteurella* infection.
10. If indicated, **culture** any purulent material for bacterial culture and sensitivity.

## Injections

### Intramuscular (IM) Injection Sites

Two primary intramuscular injection sites are used in rabbits:

1. **Lumbar epaxial muscles (longissimus dorsi)**:
   - Located along either side of the lumbar spine.
   - This is the most commonly used IM injection site in rabbits.
   - Palpate the lumbar spine and inject into the muscle mass lateral to the dorsal spinous processes.
   - Use a 25-gauge needle.
   - Maximum volume: approximately 0.5-1 mL per site, depending on the size of the rabbit.

2. **Quadriceps (cranial thigh) muscle**:
   - Located on the cranial aspect of the thigh (cranial femoral muscles).
   - Palpate the femur and inject into the muscle mass on the cranial/lateral aspect.
   - Use a 25-gauge needle.
   - Maximum volume: approximately 0.5-1 mL per site.
   - **Caution**: Avoid the sciatic nerve, which runs along the caudal aspect of the femur. Always inject into the cranial or lateral thigh, not the caudal thigh.

> **NOTE:** The caudal thigh muscles should be **avoided** due to the risk of sciatic nerve damage.

### Subcutaneous (SC) Injection Sites

- The **interscapular region** (scruff, between the shoulder blades) is the most commonly used site for subcutaneous injections and subcutaneous fluid administration.
- Gently tent the skin over the interscapular area.
- Insert a 22- to 25-gauge needle into the subcutaneous space at the base of the skin tent.
- Inject the medication slowly.
- The **lateral thorax** and **lateral flank** can also be used for subcutaneous injections.
- Subcutaneous fluids can be given in volumes of **10-15 mL/kg per site** in the interscapular region.

## Venipuncture

### Venous Access Sites

The following veins can be used for venipuncture (blood collection) or catheter placement in rabbits:

1. **Marginal ear vein (lateral ear vein)**:
   - Located on the lateral aspect of the pinna.
   - Useful for small blood sample collection and IV catheter placement.
   - Apply topical EMLA cream (lidocaine/prilocaine) 30-60 minutes prior, or use a local lidocaine bleb to reduce pain.
   - Use a 25- or 27-gauge needle or butterfly catheter.
   - Avoid the **central ear artery** (located on the dorsal midline of the pinna).

2. **Central ear artery**:
   - Located along the dorsal midline of the pinna.
   - Can be used for arterial blood gas sampling.
   - Not routinely used for venipuncture (it is an artery).
   - Apply pressure after sampling to prevent hematoma formation.

3. **Lateral saphenous vein**:
   - Located on the lateral aspect of the hind limb, crossing the lateral surface of the tarsus (hock).
   - This is an excellent site for blood collection in rabbits.
   - See detailed technique below.

4. **Cephalic vein**:
   - Located on the dorsal aspect of the forelimb, similar to dogs and cats.
   - Can be used for blood collection and IV catheter placement.
   - Clip the fur if needed to visualize the vein.

5. **Jugular vein**:
   - Located in the jugular groove, similar to dogs and cats.
   - Can be used for larger volume blood collection.
   - Requires good restraint or sedation.
   - The large dewlap in some rabbits may make this site more difficult to access.

### Lateral Saphenous Vein Venipuncture: Detailed Technique

The lateral saphenous vein is the preferred venipuncture site for this lab.

**Equipment:**
- 25- or 27-gauge needle attached to a 1 mL or 3 mL syringe (or a 25-gauge butterfly catheter).
- Alcohol or chlorhexidine for skin preparation.
- Cotton ball or gauze for hemostasis.
- Clippers (optional, to remove fur over the vein).

**Procedure:**

1. **Restrain the rabbit** appropriately. The rabbit can be placed on the table in sternal recumbency, or the burrito technique can be used with the hind limb exposed. An assistant should restrain the rabbit while the phlebotomist performs the blood draw.
2. **Extend the hind limb** caudally and laterally by gently grasping the leg above the hock.
3. **Clip the fur** over the lateral tarsus (hock region) if needed to visualize the vein. The lateral saphenous vein crosses the lateral surface of the hock.
4. The assistant should occlude the vein by applying gentle pressure **proximal** to the hock (above the sampling site), acting as a tourniquet. This can be done by gently wrapping the hand around the leg above the tarsus.
5. **Prepare the skin** with alcohol or chlorhexidine.
6. **Identify the vein**. The lateral saphenous vein should be visible or palpable crossing the lateral hock.
7. Insert the needle at a **shallow angle** (10-20 degrees) into the vein, with the **bevel up**.
8. Gently aspirate. Blood should flow into the syringe. If using a butterfly catheter, blood will appear in the tubing.
9. Collect the required blood volume. The **safe blood collection volume** is approximately **1% of body weight** (e.g., 10 mL from a 1 kg rabbit, though in practice smaller volumes are typically collected). A more conservative maximum is 0.5-1 mL/100 g body weight.
10. **Release the tourniquet** (assistant releases pressure above the hock).
11. **Remove the needle** and immediately apply pressure with a cotton ball or gauze for at least **60 seconds** to achieve hemostasis.
12. Transfer blood to the appropriate collection tubes (EDTA for CBC, lithium heparin or serum separator for chemistry).

> **Tips:**
> - If blood flow stops, gently reposition the needle. The vein may have collapsed or the needle may have gone through the vein.
> - Warming the limb with a warm compress prior to venipuncture may help dilate the vein.
> - Use the smallest gauge needle appropriate for the sample volume needed.
> - Avoid excessive negative pressure on the syringe, as this can collapse the vein and hemolyze the sample.
