## Body Weight and Body Condition Score

- **Weigh the rabbit** in kilograms using a gram scale.
- Assign a **body condition score (BCS)** on a scale of 1-5:
  - **1 - Very Thin**: Hip bones, ribs, and spine are very sharp to the touch. Loss of muscle and no fat cover. The rump area curves in.
  - **2 - Thin**: Hip bones, ribs, and spine are easily felt. Loss of muscle and very little fat cover. Rump area is flat.
  - **3 - Ideal**: Hip bones, ribs, and spine easily felt but are rounded, not sharp. Ribs feel like a pocket full of pens. No abdominal bulge. Rump area is flat.
  - **4 - Overweight**: Pressure is needed to feel the ribs, spine, and hip bones. Some fat layers. The rump is rounded.
  - **5 - Obese**: Very hard to feel the spine and hip bones. Ribs cannot be felt. Tummy sags with obvious fat padding. Rump bulges out.

## Skin Turgor (Hydration Status)

- Gently tent the skin over the **interscapular area** (between the shoulder blades).
- Normal skin should return to its resting position within **1-2 seconds**.
- Prolonged skin tenting suggests **dehydration**.
- Note: Obese rabbits may have normal skin turgor even when dehydrated due to excess subcutaneous fat. Thin rabbits may have prolonged skin turgor even when normally hydrated.

---

## Cardiovascular System

- Auscultate the heart on both sides of the thorax using your stethoscope.
- **Normal heart rate (HR): 140-180 bpm** (may be up to 220-325 bpm when stressed).
- Note the **rate, rhythm, and character** of the heart sounds.
- Listen for any **murmurs, arrhythmias, or muffled heart sounds**.
- Evaluate **mucous membrane color**: should be pink. Pale, cyanotic, or hyperemic membranes are abnormal.
- Assess **capillary refill time (CRT)**: should be less than 2 seconds.
- Palpate **peripheral pulses** (central ear artery).

> **NOTE:** The rabbits have been sedated with midazolam. Sedation may affect heart rate, respiratory rate, and mentation. Keep this in mind when interpreting your examination findings. Some procedures such as otoscopic and oral examinations are very challenging to perform on awake rabbits and are best done under sedation.

## Otoscopic Examination

- Use an otoscope with a small cone (2-3 mm) to examine both ear canals and tympanic membranes.
- **Gently restrain** the rabbit. Sedation or the burrito technique may be helpful.
- Hold the pinna (ear) gently and direct the otoscope cone into the vertical ear canal.
- Evaluate the ear canal for:
  - **Erythema** (redness)
  - **Discharge** (ceruminous, purulent, or hemorrhagic)
  - **Debris or foreign material**
  - **Masses or polyps**
  - **Parasites** (e.g., *Psoroptes cuniculi* - ear mites)
- Visualize the **tympanic membrane** if possible. It should be intact, translucent, and pearly grey.
- Note that rabbit ear canals have a significant **vertical and horizontal component**.
- In lop-eared breeds, the ear canal may be more tortuous and difficult to examine.

## Dental and Oral Examination

- Rabbits are **elodont** (continuously growing teeth) with a dental formula of **I2/1, C0/0, P3/2, M3/3 = 28 teeth**.
- The small peg teeth (second upper incisors) are located directly behind the upper primary incisors.
- Evaluate the **incisors** by gently retracting the lips:
  - Check for **malocclusion**, overgrowth, fractures, or discoloration.
  - Upper incisors should slightly overlap the lower incisors.
  - Look for the **peg teeth** behind the upper incisors.
- Evaluate the **cheek teeth (premolars and molars)** using an otoscope or oral speculum/cheek dilators:
  - This is best performed under **sedation**.
  - Insert the speculum or cheek dilators gently between the incisors and premolars (the diastema).
  - Use a light source to illuminate the oral cavity.
  - Evaluate for **molar spurs** (sharp points), especially on the buccal aspect of upper cheek teeth and the lingual aspect of lower cheek teeth.
  - Look for **tongue entrapment** by lingual spurs of the lower cheek teeth.
  - Assess for **oral ulceration**, abscesses, or mucosal lesions.
  - Note any **purulent material** or food impaction.
- Palpate the **ventral mandible** for any swelling or irregularity that may indicate tooth root abscessation or elongation.

## Remaining Physical Examination

### Lymph Nodes
- Palpate the **submandibular** lymph nodes.
- Palpate the **prescapular** lymph nodes.
- Palpate the **axillary** lymph nodes.
- Palpate the **inguinal** lymph nodes.
- Palpate the **popliteal** lymph nodes.
- Note any **enlargement, asymmetry, firmness, or pain** on palpation.

### Dewlap
- The **dewlap** is a fold of skin and subcutaneous fat under the chin, particularly prominent in **intact female** rabbits and **obese** rabbits.
- Inspect the dewlap for **moist dermatitis** (dewlap dermatitis or "wet dewlap"), which occurs when the skin fold remains chronically moist.
- Note any alopecia, erythema, discharge, or odor.

### Masses
- Palpate the entire body systematically for any **subcutaneous masses, swellings, or abscesses**.
- Rabbit abscesses are typically **encapsulated** and contain thick, caseous (cottage cheese-like) pus, unlike the liquid pus seen in dogs and cats.
- Note the location, size, shape, consistency, and mobility of any masses found.

---

## Upper Respiratory System

- Observe the **nares** (nostrils) for any discharge (serous, mucoid, or purulent).
- Note any **sneezing, nasal congestion, or stertor** (upper airway noise).
- Evaluate for **matting of the fur** on the medial forelimbs, which indicates the rabbit has been wiping nasal discharge with its paws.
- Common causes of upper respiratory disease in rabbits include *Pasteurella multocida*, *Bordetella bronchiseptica*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, and dental disease.

---

## Ocular Examination

- Evaluate both eyes for:
  - **Symmetry** of the globes.
  - **Discharge** (serous, mucoid, or purulent). Epiphora (excessive tearing) may indicate nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
  - **Conjunctival hyperemia** or chemosis.
  - **Corneal clarity**: Evaluate for ulcers, opacities, or neovascularization using a penlight.
  - **Pupil size and symmetry**: Evaluate pupillary light reflexes (PLR) - note that rabbits have a relatively slow and incomplete PLR.
  - **Lens**: Look for cataracts (lens opacity). *Encephalitozoon cuniculi* can cause phacoclastic uveitis.
  - **Third eyelid**: Evaluate the nictitating membrane for protrusion or abnormalities.
  - **Periorbital region**: Palpate for retrobulbar swelling or exophthalmos, which may indicate retrobulbar abscess (commonly associated with tooth root elongation).
- Perform **retropulsion** of the globes: Gently push each globe posteriorly through the closed eyelids to evaluate for retrobulbar masses or abscesses. Compare both sides. Resistance to retropulsion or asymmetry suggests retrobulbar disease.

---

## Lower Respiratory System

- **Normal respiratory rate (RR): 30-60 breaths per minute.**
- Auscultate both sides of the thorax for **lung sounds**.
- Normal rabbits are **obligate nasal breathers**. Open-mouth breathing is a sign of severe respiratory distress.
- Evaluate for:
  - **Increased respiratory rate** (tachypnea).
  - **Increased respiratory effort** (dyspnea) - look for abdominal component, nostril flaring, head extension.
  - **Abnormal lung sounds**: crackles, wheezes, or areas of decreased/absent sounds.
  - **Referred upper airway sounds** can be transmitted to the thorax, so always auscultate the trachea as well.

---

## Abdomen

- Abdominal palpation is an essential component of the rabbit physical examination. Rabbits are relatively easy to palpate due to their lack of a large omentum.
- Place the rabbit on the exam table on a non-slip surface.
- Use **both hands** to gently palpate the abdomen systematically.

### Stomach
- The stomach is located in the **left cranial abdomen**, tucked under the rib cage.
- The stomach should always contain some ingesta (food material). An empty stomach is abnormal and may suggest anorexia or GI stasis.
- Assess the stomach for **size, consistency, and the presence of gas or fluid**.
- A doughy, large stomach may suggest GI stasis. A tympanic (gas-filled) stomach is an emergency.

### Cecum
- The cecum is the **largest organ** in the rabbit abdomen and is located in the **ventral and right abdomen**.
- It should feel like a soft, doughy, tubular structure.
- Assess for distension, gas, or impaction.

### Intestines
- Palpate for **intestinal loops**. They should be soft and non-painful.
- Note any thickening, distension, masses, or gas.
- Small intestinal loops should be mobile and non-tender.

### Kidneys
- The **left kidney** is more caudal and mobile than the right kidney.
- The **right kidney** is more cranial and partially tucked under the rib cage.
- Palpate both kidneys for **size, shape, symmetry, and pain**.
- Normal kidneys should be smooth and bean-shaped.

### Bladder
- The urinary bladder is located in the **caudal ventral abdomen**.
- Assess for **size and distension**.
- Note: Rabbit urine is normally **thick and creamy** due to high calcium carbonate content. A palpably large or firm bladder may indicate urinary sludge or urolithiasis.

### Liver
- The liver is in the **cranial abdomen**, mostly under the rib cage.
- It is generally not palpable unless enlarged (hepatomegaly).

## Urogenital Examination

### Female
- Evaluate the **vulva** for discharge, swelling, or discoloration.
- Palpate the **uterus** if possible (located in the caudal ventral abdomen). A large or palpable uterus may suggest pregnancy, pyometra, or uterine neoplasia.
- Note: **Uterine adenocarcinoma** is extremely common in intact female rabbits over 3-4 years of age (incidence up to 60-80% by 5-6 years).
- Check the **mammary glands** for swelling, masses, or discharge (mammary neoplasia can occur).
- The **inguinal glands** (located in the inguinal skin folds lateral to the genitalia) should be evaluated. These are scent glands that can accumulate waxy secretions and debris. Clean if needed.

### Male
- Evaluate the **prepuce** and **penis** by gently extruding the penis from the prepuce.
- The **testicles** should be palpated in the **inguinal region**. Male rabbits have open inguinal rings and can retract their testicles into the abdomen.
- Note any testicular **asymmetry, swelling, or masses**.
- The **inguinal glands** should be evaluated as in the female.

---

## Feet Examination

- Examine all four feet, paying particular attention to the **plantar surface (soles)** of the hind feet.
- Rabbits do **not have footpads** like dogs and cats. Instead, the plantar surface is covered with dense fur.
- Evaluate for **pododermatitis** (sore hocks / ulcerative pododermatitis):
  - Early stages: fur loss and callus formation on the plantar metatarsal area.
  - Advanced stages: ulceration, erythema, swelling, scab formation, and secondary infection.
  - Severe cases can progress to osteomyelitis.
- Risk factors for pododermatitis include obesity, wire-bottom cages, inadequate bedding, wet/soiled substrate, inactivity, and Rex breeds (thinner foot fur).
- Evaluate the **nails** for overgrowth, fractures, or abnormalities. Trim if needed.

## Brief Neurological Examination

- Assess **mentation**: alert, quiet, depressed, obtunded, stuporous, or comatose (keep sedation in mind).
- Evaluate **gait and posture**: ataxia, paresis, head tilt, circling, or rolling.
- **Head tilt** (torticollis/vestibular disease) is common in rabbits and can be caused by *Encephalitozoon cuniculi* (protozoal infection) or *Pasteurella multocida* (otitis media/interna).
- Assess **postural reactions** (proprioception) by turning the paw over (knuckling) on each limb.
- Evaluate **cranial nerve function**:
  - Menace response (CN II, VII) - note that this can be inconsistent in rabbits.
  - Pupillary light reflex (CN II, III).
  - Palpebral reflex (CN V, VII).
  - Physiologic nystagmus (CN VIII) - slow, horizontal nystagmus can be normal.
- Note any **nystagmus** (pathological): direction, type (horizontal, vertical, rotary), and whether it is spontaneous or positional.
- Assess **muscle tone** and **withdrawal reflexes** in all four limbs.
- Evaluate the **perineal reflex** (anal tone).

---

## Rectal Temperature

- **Normal rectal temperature: 101-104°F (38.3-40°C).**
- Use a **digital thermometer** with lubricant.
- Gently insert the thermometer into the rectum approximately 2-3 cm.
- Note: Rabbits are prone to **hyperthermia** (heat stress) at environmental temperatures above 85°F (29°C). They cannot pant or sweat effectively and rely on vasodilation of their ear pinnae for thermoregulation.
- **Hypothermia** may be seen in severely ill, debilitated, or shocked rabbits.
